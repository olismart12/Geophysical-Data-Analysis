# Geophysical Data Analysis
This project involves developing a Python tool to analyze geophysical data for predicting ore body locations. Using Pandas and NumPy, data processing speed was increased by 30%. Machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines (SVMs) implemented in Scikit-learn, were used to achieve an 85% accuracy rate in predictions. The repository includes the scripts and datasets used for analysis and model training.

# Technologies Used:

Python: Main programming language for data processing and analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building predictive models.
